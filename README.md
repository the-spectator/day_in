  <strong>Record everything</strong>

Welcome to the [Day In](https://github.com/the-spectator/day_in) codebase, it is a
platform I am aiming to build to record everything I need in one place. This project
is a developer delima of "Can I implement it ? or How would I implement it?".
Right now this is a hobby project but lets see where I can take it.

## What is Day In?

In age of digital world, one has to use many services just to keep record of their daily
activities. We have to use different app for notes, expenses, dairy and much more.

_Day In_ is my attempt to centralize it in one place and build a hobby project that actually works.
